# Task Planning

## Purpose

Generate the implementation plan: dependency-ordered dynamic phases and concrete tasks with acceptance criteria. Implements `../../system/PHASE_GENERATION_RULES.md` and `TASK_GENERATION_RULES.md`. Feeds Gate 4.

## When to Use

- After architecture is set, to produce phases and tasks for approval.
- When re-planning because scope, dependencies, or discovered state changed.
- **Not** for a single obvious task with clear acceptance criteria already agreed.

## Inputs

- Architecture + repository layout.
- Selected applications, approved stack, requirement baseline.
- The relevant work-item type planning skill (feature/bug/refactor/migration).

## Discovery Questions

- What must exist before what (dependencies)?
- What is the critical path vs deferrable work?
- Which tasks can run in parallel; which touch the same files?
- What are the exit gates per phase?

## Responsibilities

- **Generate phases dynamically** from applications, dependencies, architecture, security, testing, deployment, and existing state.
- Break each phase into **tasks**: title, context, inputs, outputs, acceptance criteria, required skills, risk.
- Order tasks by dependency; mark **parallel-safe** vs **same-file** tasks.
- Attach an **exit gate** to each phase.
- Record everything in `../../work-items/` and `../../projects/current/`.

## Required Workflow

1. Read architecture + apps + stack + requirements.
2. Derive phases (dependency-ordered, right-sized).
3. For each phase, generate tasks with acceptance criteria.
4. Mark parallelizable tasks (input to `../../system/MULTI_AGENT_RULES.md`).
5. Attach testing/security requirements per phase.
6. Present for Gate 4; record on approval.

## Decision Rules

- No fixed roadmap — phases come from the actual work.
- Foundations (design system, contracts, auth) precede dependent features.
- Every bug work item includes a regression-test task.
- A task is parallel-safe only if its file scope is disjoint from concurrent tasks.
- Right-size: don't 7-phase a one-line change; don't one-phase a marketplace.

## Rules

- Every task states how it is verified (command/test/manual, or "unverified until run").
- Keep task notes concise; link, don't duplicate.
- No implementation before Gate 4 approval.

## Anti-Patterns

- Reusing one template roadmap for every project.
- Tasks with no acceptance criteria.
- Marking file-conflicting tasks as parallel.
- Over-granular tasks whose coordination cost exceeds the work.

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Phases derived from real inputs (not a template).
- [ ] Dependency ordering explicit.
- [ ] Each task: inputs, outputs, acceptance criteria, skills, risk.
- [ ] Parallel-safe vs same-file tasks marked.
- [ ] Exit gate per phase.
- [ ] Testing/security requirements attached.
- [ ] Presented for Gate 4.

## Definition of Done

Approved dynamic phases and tasks (with acceptance criteria, dependencies, and gates) recorded in `../../work-items/` and `../../projects/current/`, ready for implementation.

## Context Loading Guidance

- **Requires:** architecture, apps, stack, requirements.
- **Does not require:** full source, unrelated references, review skills' bodies.
- **May load:** the matching work-item planning skill; `testing-strategy` for test tasks.
- **Stop when:** phases + tasks are approved (Gate 4).

## Token Efficiency Guidance

Plan from summaries. Keep task records lean — status, criteria, links. Generate the next phase's tasks in detail; keep later phases coarse until reached.
