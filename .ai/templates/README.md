# `.ai/templates/` — Reusable Templates (Index)

Reusable **document templates** — fill-in-the-blank, tool-neutral. They give consistent shape to briefs, plans, work items, decisions, reviews, and reports. A template is **not** application code and does **not** commit a stack. Copy a template into `../projects/current/` or the active `../work-items/` entry and complete the bracketed sections.

## Conventions

- Fill-in-the-blank and tool-neutral; delete guidance lines when completing.
- A template is not application code and does not commit a stack.
- Templates reference canonical rules/skills by path; they don't duplicate them.
- Register each new template in this index.
