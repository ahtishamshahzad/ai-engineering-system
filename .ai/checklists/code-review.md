# Checklist: Code Review

> Verifiable items for code review. Maps to Gate 6.

## Pass Criteria

- [ ] **Correctness:** logic is right; edge cases and error paths handled.
- [ ] **Clarity:** readable; names and structure fit the surrounding code's conventions.
- [ ] **Scope discipline:** change matches its stated purpose — no scope creep, no unrelated edits.
- [ ] **AI-output failure modes** checked: no invented facts, no false completion, no silent scope change (`../skills/ai-output-review`).
- [ ] No secrets, no debug leftovers, no commented-out cruft.
- [ ] Tests present for the change's required cases; findings routed to security/performance reviewers where relevant.
- [ ] Findings reported **by severity** with file:line; no confirmed critical/high left unraised.

## Fail / Stop

- Confirmed critical/high issue; scope creep; false completion; missing required tests.
