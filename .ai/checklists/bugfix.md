# Checklist: Bug Fix

> Verifiable items for a bug fix. Maps to `../hooks/before-bugfix.md`.

## Pass Criteria

- [ ] Bug **reproduced** (or a concrete reproduction established) before fixing.
- [ ] **Root cause** identified, not just the symptom (file:line).
- [ ] Fix is **minimal** and targeted — no bundled refactors.
- [ ] A **regression test fails on the unfixed code and passes after the fix**, at the lowest capturing level (`../skills/testing/regression-testing`).
- [ ] Security-relevant bugs also get a security regression test (`../skills/security/security-regression-testing`).
- [ ] Nearby behavior unchanged; the regression test lives in the CI-gated suite.

## Fail / Stop

- No reproduction; symptom-only fix; no regression test; scope creep.
